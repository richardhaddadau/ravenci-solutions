You may be starting a new business or have a vision of a new platform, you may be revamping an existing website or wanting to expand your reach to mobile and other platforms. Whatever the case may be, where you are today is not where you want to be in five years' time or even a year's time.

Your product should not be limited but be able to grow as you grow, and as your audience grows, and as your business grows.

In order to do that, we first need to pick the right tools for the job. There is no such thing as a one-size-fits-all solution. Every product and every dream and every vision is unique, so why would the solution not be just as tailored to your vision as your passion for it is? My experience across a smorgasbord of modern programming languages, technologies and frameworks allows me to pick and choose what best suits you!

With the right tool at our disposal, I then customise the data management, storage processes and privacy strategies within to best serve the purpose at hand.
