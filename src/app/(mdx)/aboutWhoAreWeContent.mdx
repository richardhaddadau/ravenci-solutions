Since 2018, RAVENCI has been evolving and growing by, ironically, taking away. 1VINE Design was an agency offering a 
full range of services, from branding and identity to web design and development. As my client base grew, I felt 
I could serve them better by focusing on my passion for developing and designing websites and applications, 
leaving the branding for more specialised agencies.

Although I always loved design, and still do, constantly changing hats between designer and developer didn't 
allow me to operate at my best in the field I enjoyed most. If I wasn't working on client work, you would often find 
me learning a new programming language or a framework, challenging myself to learn new concepts and techniques, and 
learning to think in a new way. 

This honed my skills as a developer, but it didn't help me grow as a designer.

As I embraced a 'less is more' mentality, 1VINE Design became simply 1VINE, and eventually grew into RAVENCI, 
a development agency specialising in web and mobile application development.
